strava-bot doesn't do much of anything at the moment.

### Setup

This project is built with [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/). Clone the repository and run:
```
stack setup
stack build
```

It also requires a file containing a webhook URL generated by slack (of the form "https://hooks.slack.com/services/<identifiers>") in `secrets/slack-webhookurl`.

### Run

To run the bot:
```
stack exec strava-bot
```
